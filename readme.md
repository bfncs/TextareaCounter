# Textarea Counter for Processwire

## What it does

The module adds a possibility to define a character/word limit to textarea inputs in Processwire. It will show a live count when editing these fields.

## Installation

Just drop the files TextareaCounter.module and TextareaCounter.js in a folder called TextareaCounter in your site's modules directory. Install from the backend as you're used to.

## How to use it

To use it with a specific Textarea input field, edit the desired input in the backend and add a limit for characters and/or words. You should be ready to go.

## Credit

Most of the code was helpfully [provided](http://processwire.com/talk/topic/2343-char-counter-for-texttextarea-fields/#entry22038) by [Soma](http://processwire.com/talk/user/100-soma/) in the Processwire forums. [juagarc4](https://github.com/juagarc4) helped making it useable inside repeater fields. [Martijn](https://github.com/Da-Fecto) added the truncation option.


## Still missing

* Proper documentation
* An expansion to bring this functionality to flat text inputs as well.
